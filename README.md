# Project-Euler

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, created to practice programming, strengthen problem-solving skills, and explore algorithms, mathematics, and optimization techniques.

All solutions are developed ld school style, meaning without AI code generation, only my own reasoning, paper & pen.
